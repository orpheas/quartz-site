Hey, this is Orpheas. I like to write ([short-form](https://x.com/orphcorp) and [longer-form](https://hyperinformation.substack.com/)), read, think, and [build cool things](https://github.com/orpheas).

Currently, I'm particularly into the dynamics of information environments, human-algorithm & human-AI interaction, as well as inner work (esp as a core skill in a post-AGI world) â€” among other things.

Professionally, I work with data (data engineering, analytics, and data products & programs). In the past, I have built the data platform of one of the biggest digital asset prime brokerages and managed data across the pipeline for the ops excellence team of a big tech co.

I've also been an early contributor & investor in [Cabin DAO](https://cabin.city/), a founding member of [Interintellect](https://interintellect.com/), part of the organizing team of [Gen AI Summit](https://www.genaisummitseeurope.com/), plus a few other things that may be too illegible for most.

My educational background is in Economics & Information Systems.
